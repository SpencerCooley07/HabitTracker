# Python Habit Tracker

Python Habit Tracker is a basic Python project that can log habits and accompanying metadata. 

# Description

This project provides a simple way to:
- Add/Delete habits
- Modify habit names, descriptions, goals, and tags

It used Tkinter to create an aesthetic GUI with a light and dark theme, and JSON to store habit data in a local JSON file.
